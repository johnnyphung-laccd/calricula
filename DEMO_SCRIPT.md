- **Recently Approved** - courses that successfully made it through the process

Below that, I can see my courses displayed as cards - each showing the course code, title, department, and a colored status badge.

The demo banner at the top reminds us that in this mode, all data resets daily - perfect for training and exploration without affecting production data."

## Section 3: Course Editor - Basic Info (1:00 - 2:00)

**Time:** 60 seconds

**On Screen:**
| Action | Visual |
|--------|--------|
| Click on a draft course card | Opens course editor |
| Show 3-panel layout | Left: Stepper | Center: Form | Right: AI Assistant |
| Point to left stepper | 8 numbered sections with progress |
| Show "Basic Info" form | Course code, title, description, units, hours fields |
| Click in a field (e.g., Description) | Field gets focus |
| Type or edit text | Demonstrate the form interaction |
| Point to AI Assistant on right | Collapsible panel with chat |

**Script:**

"Let me click on a draft course to open the editor. You'll see Calricula uses a clean three-panel layout:

On the left, I have a **navigation stepper** showing all 8 sections of a Course Outline of Record:
1. Basic Info
2. CB Codes
3. SLOs
4. Content
5. Requisites
6. Cross-Listing
7. LMI Data
8. Review & Submit

The center panel is where I **edit the current section**. Here in Basic Info, I can set the course code, title, description, units, and hours in these nicely organized form fields.

And on the right - this is Calricula's secret weapon - the **AI Assistant**. It's a collapsible panel that's always available to help with suggestions, compliance checking, and answering questions about curriculum.

I'll make a quick edit here in the description field, and the changes are saved automatically."

## Section 4: AI Assistant & SLOs (2:00 - 2:45)

**Time:** 45 seconds

**On Screen:**
| Action | Visual |
|--------|--------|
| Click "3. SLOs" in stepper | Navigate to SLOs section |
| Show SLOs section | List of SLOs with "+ Add SLO" button |
| Click AI Assistant panel | Expand or show it |
| Point to quick action buttons | "Suggest Description", "Suggest SLOs", etc. |
| Click "Suggest SLOs" button | Trigger AI generation |
| Show AI loading | Spinner or loading state |
| Show generated SLOs | AI-created learning outcomes appear |
| (Optional) Click "+ Add SLO" | Show manual add option |

**Script:**

"Let me navigate to the SLOs section - Student Learning Outcomes. Here I can see existing SLOs, and I can add new ones with the '+ Add SLO' button.

Now let me show you the AI Assistant in action. I'll expand the panel on the right.

You'll see quick action buttons here. Let me click 'Suggest SLOs' to generate learning outcomes using Bloom's Taxonomy.

[pause for AI to generate - about 3-5 seconds]

There we go - the AI has generated measurable, accreditation-compliant learning outcomes tailored to my course. Each SLO follows best practices for assessment.

The AI understands California regulations, Title 5 requirements, and PCAH guidelines - so I get suggestions that are already compliant. This saves hours of research and revision time."

## Section 5: CB Codes & Compliance (2:45 - 3:15)

**Time:** 30 seconds

**On Screen:**
| Action | Visual |
|--------|--------|
| Click "2. CB Codes" in stepper | Navigate to CB Codes section |
| Show CB codes form | Multiple dropdown/checkbox fields organized by category |
| Point to a few example fields | CB00 (Basic Data), CB01 (Course ID), CB02 (TOP Code), etc. |
| Scroll through section | Show the extensive list of codes |
| (Optional) Show validation | Green checkmarks or indicators |

**Script:**

"Let me click on CB Codes. Every California community college course needs 27 specific compliance codes - the CB codes. This used to mean hours of cross-referencing state documents.

In Calricula, these codes are integrated directly into the workflow. I can see all the codes here, organized by category - from basic data like course ID and TOP code, to more specialized fields.

What's really helpful is that many of these codes are intelligently pre-filled based on my course information. I just need to review and adjust as needed.

This compliance-first design means courses are more likely to be approved on the first submission, reducing back-and-forth with the curriculum committee."

## Section 6: Review & Submit (3:15 - 4:00)

**Time:** 45 seconds

**On Screen:**
| Action | Visual |
|--------|--------|
| Click "8. Review & Submit" in stepper | Navigate to final section |
| Show review page | Summary of all course data, progress indicators |
| Scroll through summary | Show all sections are complete |
| Point to "Submit for Review" button | Primary action button |
| (Optional) Point to status badges | Green checks for completed sections |

**Script:**

"When I'm finished with all sections, I come to Review & Submit. This gives me a complete overview of my course - I can see every section at a glance with progress indicators.

[pause to scroll]

You'll see green checkmarks next to completed sections, and any incomplete items are flagged here. This makes it easy to catch anything I missed before submitting.

Once everything looks good, I click 'Submit for Review' to send it to my curriculum chair. The course then moves through the approval stages: Department Review, Curriculum Committee, Articulation Review, and finally Approved.

This clear, tracked workflow eliminates confusion and speeds up the approval timeline - everyone knows exactly where a course is in the process."

## Section 7: Course Library (4:00 - 4:40)

**Script:**

"One of Calricula's most powerful features is the integrated Course Library. This gives faculty access to every Course Outline of Record from all nine LACCD colleges - right from within the app.

Let me click on Library in the sidebar. Here I can search across all courses and filter by college.

I'll type 'Mathematics' to search...

[pause for results]

The results appear as course cards showing the code, title, institution, and status. I can also filter by a specific college using this dropdown - all nine LACCD colleges are available.

When I click on a course, I get a detailed modal with the complete outline - description, SLOs, compliance codes, everything.

This is invaluable when creating new courses or aligning curriculum across institutions. Faculty can reference existing courses, adapt them for their needs, and ensure consistency across the district."

**Script:**

"To wrap up, Calricula combines three powerful capabilities:

2. **AI Assistance** - Generate compliant content in seconds, not hours
3. **Workflow Management** - Clear approval process with full tracking

The result? Courses that are compliant, consistent, and approved faster - freeing faculty to focus on what matters most: teaching and learning.

Best of all, we have this demo environment where you can explore all features risk-free.

Thanks for watching, and I'd be happy to answer any questions!"

## Production Notes

### Visual Tips:
- **Mouse cursor**: Keep movements smooth and deliberate
- **Pacing**: Pause briefly after each action for viewers to process
- **Zoom**: Consider zooming in slightly on form fields for readability
- **Highlighting**: Use subtle cursor highlights to draw attention to key areas

### Technical Setup:
- **Screen resolution**: 1920x1080 minimum
- **Browser**: Chrome or Firefox (hide bookmark bar)
- **Microphone**: Quality mic for clear voiceover
- **Lighting**: Good lighting if you appear on camera

### Timing Adjustments:
If running short/long, adjust:
- Section 3 (Course Editor): Can expand to 90 seconds or shrink to 30 seconds
- Section 7 (Library): Can be omitted if time-constrained
- AI demo: Most engaging - prioritize this section if needed

### Backup Plan:
Have these ready in case something fails:
- Screenshots of key screens as B-roll
- Pre-recorded clips of AI responses
- Alternative demo courses pre-loaded
