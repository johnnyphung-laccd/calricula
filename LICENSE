BRANDING REQUIREMENTS

In addition to the BSD 3-Clause terms above, the following branding requirements
apply to any use or distribution of this software:

You may NOT alter, remove, or obscure any "Calricula" branding, including but
not limited to logos, name references, and visual identity elements present in
the user interface, UNLESS one of the following exemptions applies:

EXEMPTIONS:

1. SMALL DEPLOYMENTS: Your deployment serves 50 or fewer users in any 30-day
   rolling period.

2. SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS: You have made consistent, substantive contributions
   to the project for at least one year AND have received explicit written
   permission from the project maintainers.

3. ENTERPRISE LICENSE: You have entered into a separate commercial agreement
   that explicitly permits branding modifications.

ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS:

- You may not use "Powered by Calricula" or similar phrases as a substitute
  for displaying the required branding elements.

- You may not co-brand the software with your own branding in a way that
  gives your brand equal or greater prominence than Calricula branding.

- You may not market derivative works as official Calricula products or
  suggest official endorsement without written permission.

For branding exemption requests or enterprise licensing inquiries, please
contact the project maintainers via GitHub.
